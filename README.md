# ArctixAxi.github.io

[ArctixAxi.github.io](https://ArcticAxi.github.io) is a minimalist, dark-theme website showcasing some poetry using GitHub Pages. The intention was to create an aesthetically pleasing experience where a user's attention is guided towards the poetry and imagery.

## Markdown, HTML, and CSS
The website uses only static HTML and CSS. The HTML files are built using a custom static site generator script in Python using a set of HTML and Markdown files. New poems can easily be added using Markdown, greatly streamlines the process of uploading new poems. Additionally, the BeautifulSoup library allows for the reusing of HTML components without JavaScript or server-side processing.

## Fonts
The fonts Fire Sans and Bahianita are used, both published under the Open Fonts License. Fire Sans was chosen for its simple elegance and is used for the titles and paragraphs. Bahianita is used in the headers, representing arctic ice floes to give the website a more individualized character.
