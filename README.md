# ArcticAxi's poetry hub

This is a minimalist dark-theme website showcasing some of my poetry using GitHub pages. The intention was to create an aesthetically pleasing website that is not overwhelming.

Built using a simple HTML structure and CSS, with the tiniest sprinkle of JS. The font Fire Sans was chosen for its simple elegance and was used for the titles and paragraphs. Bahianita was used in the headers. I chose it to represent the ice floes in the arctic and to give a more individualized character to the website.
