                    This website is dedicated to the best mum I could've wished for. 
                    She inspires me to express myself creatively, to follow my own interests and heart, and to challenge myself. 
                    Without her support I would not be where I am today. 
                </p>

                <p class="justified">
                    The poems on this website were mostly written shortly after her passing. 
                    They are a select few of over a hundred poems, each dealing with the raw emotions I experienced at that time. 
                    I wish the greatest strength to others going through loss of any kind. 
                    It's a difficult road but you don't have to walk it alone.
