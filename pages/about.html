<h1>About</h1>
<p class="justified">
This website is dedicated to the best mum I could've wished for. She inspires me to express myself creatively, to follow my own interests and heart, and to challenge myself. Without her support I would not be where I am today. 
</p>
<br>
<p class="justified">
The poems on this website were mostly written shortly after her passing. They are a select few of over a hundred poems, each dealing with the raw emotions I experienced at that time. I wish the greatest strength to others going through loss of any kind. It's a difficult road but you don't have to walk it alone.
