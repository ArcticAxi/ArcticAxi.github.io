when will the pounding stop?
begging me to open that door
incessantly knocking

each page filled with pain
bleeding out slowly

imagine what it'd be like
to start over

to simpler, quieter times
to relish in the silence
the only sound your laughter
without a single knock
no door to open 
no peering into the beyond
