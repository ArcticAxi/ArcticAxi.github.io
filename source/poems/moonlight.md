from time to time
blue moonlight fills the sky
transforming the darkness
revealing silhouettes
shadows of a past that was
a future that could've been

I see you standing there
waving me goodbye
as I leave for vacation

if only I had known then
what I know now

that it wasn't me who was leaving

your birthday was in a few days

if only you had had your birthday
I could've seen you again then
if only for one last time
I could've seen you again
