if only you knew
how much I 
miss you

walking into the
grocery store

I'd kill to do that 
together again

without you here
nothing is right
emptiness takes space in
my heart as I
desperately scan my
items to leave because the
air is suffocating as I
see shadows of the
past unfold
in front of 
my 
eyes
